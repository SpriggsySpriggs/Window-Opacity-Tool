# Window-Opacity-Tool
A tool written in QB64 utilizing PowerShell scripts and the Windows API to set opacity levels of Desktop applications (as well as some store apps). A Windows 10 must-have for those who love to customize.
What this program does:
Allows the user to select a window to manipulate and set opacity level.

What this program can't do:
It can't filter out programs that are not compatible and can't force a window to accept opacity changes. The window must already be compatible through the Windows API.

# NOTICE:
----------------------------------
The program requires PowerShell in order to run correctly. On first launch, the program will check to make sure your computer has been set up to run scripts. From there, you should be able to run the program normally. Sometimes PowerShell will truncate the remaining letters of a window title. Click the refresh button a few times until it is resolved. This is not a fault of my program, but of PowerShell.

This program comes with no warranties of any sort, express or implied.

Source code will be available in the repository. Requires QB64 to compile.
